# Linear Regression Implementations

This repo will contain different implementations of linear regression.

Here are the current implementations that are present:

1. Closed-form solution of linear regression
2. Linear regression with Pytorch using gradient descent algorithm.

## To-Do:
1. Linear regression using QR decomposition
2. Linear regression using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)
3. Linear regression with L1 and L2 Regularization
4. Linear regression from Maximum Likelihood Estimation
